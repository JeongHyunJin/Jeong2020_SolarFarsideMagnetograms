Pix2PixHD model
=============
Solar farside magnetograms are generated by the Pix2PixHD model using pairs of SDO/AIA EUV passband images and SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms.   


Network architectures
-------------
The model consists of two major networks: one is a generative network (generator, G) and the other is a discriminative network (discriminator, D).
The generator tries to generate realistic output from input, and the discriminator tries to distinguish which one is a more real-like pair between a real pair and a fake pair.   



Hyperparameters
