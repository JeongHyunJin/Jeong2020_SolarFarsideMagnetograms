* Hyperparameters

 We initialize weights in convolutional and transposed convolutional layers with a normal distribution whose mean is 0 and standard deviation is 0.02.
 For optimization, we use the Adam solver with an initial learning rate of 0.0002, coefficients beta1 and beta2 for computing running averages of gradients and their squares.
